    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
    <strong><u><a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/script">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS
    </a></u></strong>, is a programming language that
    conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time
    compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
    object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
        <p>
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
    [10] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[11] often incorporating
    third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute
    the code on the user's device.
