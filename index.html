      <strong>The World Wide Web</strong> (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system
      where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource
      Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by
      hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the
      Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed
      by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a
      software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous
      with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and
      upon which technologies the Web is built.</p>
